                <p class="lead">
                    This study investigated the origins of cooperation by analysing the effects of individual relatedness and patch richness on the levels of cooperation observed. As a secondary measure, other factors leading to the evolution of cooperation were explored.
                    <br>
                    <br> A range of relatedness values were tested in four different environments with varying resource distributions. The results showed a positive relationship between agent relatedness and the level of cooperation experienced.
                    <br> The results allowed commentary on the validity of the game theoretic model by Reeve and Hölldobler and provided insight into the origins of cooperation. The study was able to agree with two of the organizational trends mentioned by Reeve and Hölldobler, indicating that higher levels of agent relatedness and higher levels of patch richness (resource density) both lead to higher levels of within-group cooperation.

                    The following tables depict a positive relationship between the relatedness threshold value and the level of within-group cooperation experienced. From these tables it is also possible to compare the results across environments in order to determine how much the environmental configuration affects cooperation.
                    <br>
                    <br> The correlations depicted below were used to comment on factors which possibly lead to the increase of within-group cooperation. The correlations are between within-group cooperation and (i) group size (Correlation 1), (ii) number of competing groups (Correlation 2), (iii) group-diversity, (Correlation 3) and (iv) population-diversity (Correlation 4).
                    <br>
                    <br> Finally stable ranges depicted were specific cases in each environment where the values obtained from one RT value were not significantly different from the previous

                        This study supports the effectiveness of agent-based models as complementary tools to mathematical models formulated about biological processes and using this information we were able to develop an ABS.
                        <br>
                        <br> The simulation allowed us to replicate the evolutionary and adaptive processes of nature, while observing the impact of changing key parameters (such as genetic relatedness and patch richness), which cannot be done in real-world biological experiments.
                        <br>
                        <br> The results from this simulation agree with the first organizational trend presented by Reeve and Hölldobler and the first hypothesis of this study. Therefore genetic relatedness has a strong effect on the degree of cooperation experienced contrary to the belief of studies by Nowak <em>et al</em> and Wilson.
                        <br>
                        <br> In a similar vein to the results obtained by Reeve and Hölldobler, this simulation did not prove that relatedness is the only necessity for the occurrence within-group cooperation. Other factors, such as Patch Richness and environmental competition, were also found to play an effect.
                        <br>
                        <br> A possible avenue of future work would firstly include a repetition of this study on more environments in order to compare the strength that both relatedness and patch richness have on the cooperation values obtained.
                        <br>
                        <br> Another addition may include different configurations of starting agents (number of agents, number of groups and so on), to determine if the evolution of the system was solely a consequence of the experimental measures or rather as a direct consequence of the configuration of starting agents in the environment.
