                    Cooperative behaviour can be found in many insect societies, and is advantageous to the long term survival of a species.
                    <br>
                    <br> Observations of cooperative societies by have revealed several organizational trends relating to the increase in cooperation between members of certain species [1]. These trends have provided insight into the origins of cooperation, and informed the design of the Nested Tug-of-War model.

In order to do this, an Agent-Based simulation was constructed which facilitated three separate experiments, the aim of each being to evaluate a single aspect of the model. Together, our results serve as an assessment of the model as a whole and provided insight into the possible origins of cooperation in biological societies.

                            How eusociality (and cooperation in general) may have evolved is a question of great interest in the field of biology. Classical Darwinism, which acts on a purely individual and competitive basis, does not seem able to properly account for cooperative and altruistic behaviour to the degree which it is observed in nature. Several theories, such as kin selection [2], reciprocal altruism [3], and tug-of-war theory [1] offer alternative explanations, or augmentations to classical Darwinism, in order to understand how cooperation may have evolved.
                            <br>
                            <br>This research focused primarily on the Nested Tug-of-War model [1]. In this model agents are faced with the problem of how to partition their energy between investment in between-group competition versus investment in within-group competition [1], as seen in Fig 1. This model suggests that cooperative behaviour emerges as a bi-product of particular organizational trends. Examples of these include factors such as genetic relatedness between agents in a group, the number of individuals in a group, as well as the level of between-group competition, which are all expected to play a role in evolution and specifically increase of cooperation found in species.

                    <p class="lead">
                        In the Nested Tug-of-War model, the concept of cooperation was never specifically defined. For the purpose of this research cooperation is defined as an agents expenditure of energy towards the betterment of their group. Where at any time, an agent may choose to expend their energy by foraging for resources for their group or rather remain motionless. In this scenario, the agent is cooperating.
                        <br>
                        <br> By expending energy towards their groups, agents act cooperatively, alternatively, by remaining motionless, agents conserve their own energy, and receive a share of the resources collected by other agents. In this situation, the agent is acting selfishly and competing within its own group.

                            The agent population consisted of multiple agents, each with a randomly generated Artificial Neural Network (ANN), making use of a Cauchy Distribution for weight initialization.
                            <br>
                            <br> ANNs are based on the biology of the brain, where the interconnected nodes making up the ANN can be compared to the interconnected neurons of the brain [4]. The links between the nodes in the ANN can be thought of as synapses.
                            <br>
                            <br> ANNs are able to provide a robust approach to approximating functions where, as shown by Cybenko [5] a fully-connected neural network with a single hidden layer is able to approximate any continuous function (Universal Function Approximator). These structures are therefore useful when simulating biological behaviour.
                            <br>
                            <br> The ANN held a one to one mapping [6] where the genotype consisted of a vector of floating point values which represented the ANN weights. Agents required an ANN design that was able to represent both cooperative and selfish behaviour and thus the inputs needed to be carefully chosen.
                            <br>
                            <br> The inputs to the ANN therefore consisted of a scaled value of both the agent's current energy and the squared distance between the agent and its closest resource. Based on this input the agent's ANN output value would determine how they would like to act within the environment and foraging task at hand (act selfishly or cooperatively).

                        Automated controller design [7, 8] is a process used to create novel agent controllers without the need for human interaction. Controllers are responsible for the actions of agents within an environment, and must be designed to be able to perform as best as possible for the task at hand (for example, resource foraging, reproduction, collaborative box pushing).
                        <br>
                        <br> Although it is possible for these to be designed by hand (known as heuristic controllers), these are limited as they cannot anticipate all possible situations in complex environments.

                            Neuro-Evolution (NE) [9] is the adaptation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and follows the process as detailed by Fig 4. NE is used to adapt the weights of an ANN until an optimal configuration is found.

                            <br> It does so by using an EA to search for specific network configurations within a set of candidate solutions by crossing over and mutating agent ANNs, finally producing adapted offspring. The weights control an agent’s behaviour [10], and therefore as these weights are adapted the agent’s behaviour is refined.

                            <br> This process results in the autonomous creation and evolution of agent controllers. Due to the use of the EAs, NE is helpful to use in situations where we do not know correct training examples and acts as a form of unsupervised learning.

                        The Nested Tug-of-War model by Reeve and Hölldobler, predicts the emergence of organizational trends that are observed in cooperative societies in the biological world. The following three trends were the focus of the studies.

                            <br> A range of relatedness values were tested in four different environments with varying resource distributions. The results showed a positive relationship between agent relatedness and the level of cooperation experienced.

                            <br> The study was therefore able to agree with the trend mentioned in the Nested Tug-of-War model, indicating that higher levels of agents relatedness lead to higher levels of within-group cooperation. The results further indicated that other factors, for example, Patch Richness (environmental competition), were also found to affect the levels of cooperation found.

                            The Nested Tug-of-War model predicts higher within and between group cooperation levels in large groups when compared to small groups of agents. Artificial Life (AL) experiments are conducted to test the null hypothesis: <em>Group size effects the level of cooperation of a group</em>
                            <br>
                            <br> The AL experiments conducted used 2 groups where on of the groups starting size if fixed to 2000 and the other had a varying size of 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 agents.
                            <br>
                            <br> The level of cooperation in this study was defined by a fitness function. The results of the experiment demonstrated that the starting size of a group, and hence its group size, has an effect on the level of cooperation, in particular, the levels of between group cooperation. An example of the groups fitness is illustrated below.

                            Competition was facilitated by resource patchiness. Five difference environments were created with different resource distributions.
                            <br>
                            <br> The simulation was run 250 times up until 200 generations on each of the resource environments. The level of cooperation that evolved was recorded.
                            <br>
                            <br> Results from the experiments show that there was a statistically significant effect of between-group competition on within-group cooperation.
                            <br>
                            <br> Increasing between-group competition led to increased within-group cooperation, but only up to a point. Increasing the level of competition between groups beyond this point produced the opposite effect.
