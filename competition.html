                    "The Nested Tug-of-War model for the evolution of cooperation places a strong emphasis on the importance of between-group competition for the evolution of within-group cooperation (cooperation between agents within groups). The level of between-group competition is determined by the patchiness of resources in an environment. To test this model empirically, an Agent-Based System was created that simulates a simple foraging task. Agents in the simulation are driven by artificial neural network controllers that determine their behaviour. These controllers are adapted using Neuro-Evolution in order for agent behaviour to change over time. Multiple experiments were conducted in environments of varying resource patchiness. It was found that resource patchiness has a statistically significant effect on the level of within-group cooperation that evolves. As predicted by the Nested Tug-of-War model, increasing the level of between-group competition in an environment by manipulating resource patchiness led to an increase in the level of within-group cooperation that evolved. However, past a threshold of resource patchiness, the opposite effect was observed. This suggests that, in terms of facilitating the evolution of within-group cooperation, there is an optimum level of between-group competition."

                    The main objective of this research is to examine the relationship between within-group cooperation and between-group competition. Mathematical analysis of the Nested Tug-of-War model reveals that as between-group competition increases, so does within-group cooperation. We wish to find empirical evidence that either supports or refutes this result. Our hypotheses are therefore:

                <p class="lead">
                    In the Nested Tug-of-War model, the level of between-group competition is altered by manipulating the resource "patchiness" of the environment. In order to explore the effect of between-group competition on the evolution of within-group cooperation, experiments were conducted on each of the five resource environments below:
                </p>
                <p>Note: For each of the resource environments, the total number of resource nodes in the world remains fixed. The number of patches into which those nodes are divided, as well as the density of those patches, is what changes to facilitate between-group competition. Smaller, denser patches increase the likelihood that agents from competing groups will have to forage in the same resource patch. Longer distances between patches as they shrink means it is important for agents to get to them quickly, to get the large pay-off for their own group. both of these are reasons that resource patchiness facilitates between-group competition.</p>

		It was found that differing levels of competition, facilitated by resource patchiness, had a significant effect on the level of cooperation that evolved among agents within groups. Increasing the level of competition in an environment led to higher levels of within-group cooperation. However, this was only true up to a point, after which further increases to between-group competition had the opposite effect.

		<p class="lead"> Figure 1. above shows the level of cooperation that evolved in 200 generations for groups in each of the five resource environments. As you can see, agents in a moderately patchy environment (therefore with moderate levels of between-group competition) evolved a higher level of cooperation than any other group. Figure 2. shows the same data averaged over all generations, and more readily shows the rise and fall in within-group cooperation as the level of between-group competition increases.</p>

                <p class="lead">
			Empirical evidence in support of the Nested Tug-of-War model was found. It was shown that between-group competition, facilitated by resource patchiness, has a significant effect on the evolution of within-group cooperation. <i>H<sub>0</sub></i> is therefore rejected. Furthermore, it was found that increasing between-group competition leads to increased levels of within-group cooperation. This is strong evidence in favour of <i>H<sub>1</sub></i>.  
		</p>
		<p class="lead">
			The non-linearity of the relationship between between-group competition and within-group cooperation was unexpected. This finding suggests that there may be an optimal level of competition required for the evolution of cooperation dependent on a specific environment. Determining this optimal level of competition as a factor of various environmental factors (such as colony size and genetic relatedness, etc.) is a promising avenue for future research.
